This is an automated retail store that doesn't need you to wait in long queues and go through bar code scanners. 

Instead it needs one camera that can recognize your face and read all the QR codes marked on the items . 

Very fast and very convenient.  

There have been 2 YouTube videos made to show a demo. and I'll be adding the links here :

And also we have a website hosted and the link for that is here :https://raghavendra-stores.firebaseapp.com/

Ah. Maybe you want to run this project right?

It would be rude of me not to give the prerequisites:

Python 3.5 or higher. This was done using 3.7 (I mentioned the previous version in case you are a time traveller)
OpenCV (python--contrib version)
PIL
Firebase-python

Mostly it wont work. Feel free to complain in the issue section. :)
Happy Copying >w<
