This is an automated retail store that doesn't need you to wait in long queues and go through bar code scanners. Instead it needs one camera that can recognize your face and read all the QR codes marked on the items . Very fast and very convenient.  There have been 2 YouTube videos made to show a demo. and I'll be adding the links here : April 5th 2020 Update: https://youtu.be/TCcBLW4gp0I and also April 8th Update :https://youtu.be/5NFbRH-eCmY and also e have a website hosted and the link for that is here :https://raghavendra-stores.firebaseapp.com/
