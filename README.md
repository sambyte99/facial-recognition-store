# facial-recognition-store
This is an automated retail store that doesn't need you to wait in long queues and go through bar code scanners. Instead it needs one camera that can recognize your face and read all the QR codes marked on the items . Very fast and very convenient.  There have been 2 YouTube videos made to show a demo. and I'll be adding the links here :
